## Challenges I Faced

### React Router Setup
* I originally used a modal for displaying individual players, but the assignment required using React Router. After talking to Mark I changed directions. 


### Search Filtering
* My search function was only filtering players from the manually added list but not the API-fetched list. 


### Debugging Missing Imports
* Completely forgot to install react-router-dom and wrap the app properly
